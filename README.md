# Store Simulator Game (aka UyeToko)

This is **my first game** that i have ever made in **unity**.

In this game you can be a owner store, that you can manage your store like restocking the shelves and serve the customers, 
but not only that, you can also build your store too even in small part in your store like customize the walls, floors, roofs, and more. 

And then if you have enough money you can expand your land, but the point is you have to buy a new shelf to unlock a newer shelf.
